# Bucketlist App

## Overview

The Bucketlist App is a web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that helps users track and manage their goals and aspirations. Users can add, update, and mark off items from their personal bucket list, while admins can manage users, including the ability to delete user accounts.

## Features

- **Create and Manage Bucket List Items**: Users can add, update, or remove items from their bucket list.
- **Mark Items as Completed**: Users can mark items as completed once they achieve their goals.
- **Admin User Management**: Admin users can delete or manage regular users.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices, styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a modern and clean look.
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign in securely to manage their bucket list items, with role-based authentication (admin and regular users).

## Purpose

The Bucketlist App encourages users to set and track goals, providing an easy and interactive way to visualize their dreams and aspirations. Admin users can manage the community by controlling user accounts.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user and bucket list data.
